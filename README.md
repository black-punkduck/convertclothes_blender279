# convertclothes_blender279
A non official clone of makeclothes (makehuman) for all those having (still) trouble with Blender 2.8

This code will be an equivalent to our makehuman directory, but only work for blender2.79. If you are familiar with newer blender versions you should use the official code from here https://github.com/makehumancommunity/community-plugins-makeclothes

This code will contain my own development branch of the makehuman version. So as long as we develop there, it could be more advance but also more unstable
